Now that 2021 is finished (and 2022 is going quickly), I would like to recap all the books I have read in 2021. I have leveraged the free time earned when working remotelly to read and the Ipad that Ericsson gave me to track the books read, otherwise I would have forgotten some of them.

- Object-oriented analysis and design with applications, Grady Booch.

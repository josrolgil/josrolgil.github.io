title: This is a test!

I am currently working on this personal blog, first with the aim of developing my writting skills and sintetize any topic I had been studying, and secondly, make some material available for the community :-) This is a test. Trying to check why the books post is being fully served from the main page and not this one. Maybe could be because the first paragraph needs to have a special length

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
